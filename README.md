# Lab 8 - Starter
Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
<br>
I would put automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is so that I would be able to see if my code works after every push and I wouldn't have to manually check it. After pushing, I would be able to see any errors and fix them right away.
<br>
Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?
<br>
no

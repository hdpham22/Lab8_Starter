# Lab 8 - Starter
Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
<br>
I would put automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is so that I would be able to see if my code works after every push and I wouldn't have to manually check it. After pushing, I would be able to see any errors and fix them right away.
<br>
Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?
<br>
no
<br>
Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
<br>
No I would not because unit testing is unable to test how different components interact with each other which is required for testing this particular feature.
<br>
Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
<br>
Yes I would because this test only deals with one specific feature which is what unit testing is good at.
